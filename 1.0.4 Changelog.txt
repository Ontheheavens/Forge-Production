1. Fixed NullPointerException in mission refit screens where mousing over forge hullmods caused crash.

2. Civilian grade check now allows Archean Order Civilian-grade hullmod.

3. Added a setting to disable civilian-grade requirement.

4. Corrected hullmod descriptions with regards to "available" carge space requirement, 
   while in code it was base cargo space stat derived from ShipHullSpecAPI.

   (Changing code to check for modified cargo space is unfeasible due to the nature of refit screen, 
   which clones ship instances, therefore leading to hard-to-fix wonky behaviour.)

5. Added a setting to disable cargo space requirement.

   (Adding a setting for disabling hullsize requirement requires extensive rewrite, not something I'm willing to do.)

6. Enabled Fuel Centrifuge installation on Prometheus-class hulls.

7. Moved campaign burn abilities incompatibility from tags to code and added a setting to disable it. 
   Move slowly restriction and sensor profile penalty settings are split and toggled off separately.

8. Added status lines in ability tooltip that tell whether conversion is working or halted due to insufficient inputs.

		   It is working fine on my end, but no promises.
