The operation can be considered a success: salvage crews were able to decouple autoforge installations and are now in the process of packaging the hardware. 

Nevertheless, close examinations of forge machinery revealed that these modules are decidedly unsuitable for use without external facilities such as those native to the mothership's hull - at least, in their current form. Your chief engineer notes that the modules, arcane as they might be, can theoretically be disassembled and reassembled in a form more accomodating to whatever ship happened to be available - given, of course, inevitable size constraints and the fact that performance of makeshift versions is likely to be abysmally low.",0:forgprodRecoveryRewards:Continue,
