"Antimatter Centrifuge",yrex_FuelForge,3,"0.2
",Forge,special,Special,100000,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,4,8,12,16,data.scripts.hullmods.yrex_FuelForge,"Emplaces a massive centrifuge at the heart of this ship's forge bay, allowing the production of antimatter from volatile chemicals. Freshly made antimatter is more energetic per volume and thus gives %s better fuel economy.

Furthermore, this ship is able to autonomously convert volatiles into fuel. %s times a day, depending on this ship's size, it can:

Convert %s Volatiles using %s Heavy Machinery into %s Fuel, up until the fleet's maximum fuel capacity.

Heavy Machinery is not normally lost during the production process but a few can sometimes break down.

Refining fuel tires out the crew and thus costs CR every day.","Reduces fuel use.",graphics/hullmods/yrex_centrifuge.png

",Forge,special,Special,75000,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,4,8,12,16,data.scripts.hullmods.yrex_RefineryForge,"Installs an omni-smelter in the ship's forge bay, allowing it to mass-produce replacement parts and other tools all within the hull. These facilities increase this ship's repair rate by %s.

Furthermore, this ship is able to autonomously convert ore into refined materials. %s times a day, depending on this ship's size, it can:

Refine %s Ore using %s Heavy Machinery into %s Metals.

Refine %s Transplutonic Ore using %s Heavy Machinery into %s Transplutonics.

Heavy Machinery is not normally lost during the refining process but a few can sometimes break down.

Refining ore tires out the crew and thus costs some CR every day.","Quicker repair.",graphics/hullmods/yrex_smelter.png
"Manufacturing Bay",yrex_SuppliesForge,3,0.2,Forge,special,Special,100000,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,4,8,12,16,data.scripts.hullmods.yrex_SuppliesForge,"Onboard fabricators allow this ship to store extra munitions, increasing ammo stores of all weapon types by %s. Due to the availability of ammunition, weapon crews are able to fire with impunity, increasing the rate of fire of all weapons by %s.

Furthermore, the ship is able to autonomously convert metals and transplutonics into supplies. %s times a day, depending on this ship's size, it can:

Convert %s Metals and %s Transplutonics using %s Heavy Machinery into %s Supplies.

Heavy Machinery is not normally lost during the production process but a few can sometimes break down.

Producing supplies tires out the crew and thus costs some CR every day.","Increased rate of fire.",graphics/hullmods/yrex_manufacturing.png
"Volturnian Aquarium",yrex_LobsterPot,2,"0.8
",Forge,special,Special,80000,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,4,8,12,16,data.scripts.hullmods.yrex_LobsterPot,"Installs a massive pressurized tank that simulates the depths of the Volturn sea floor. This provides a prime living space for Volturnian lobsters, allowing them to reproduce, given availability of food. The aquarium itself doubles as a recreation area, where crews can watch the lobsters in their natural environment and relax, thus increasing CR recovery rate by %s.

Lobsters consume %s food per day. While lobsters are fed, they are able to reproduce and raise their young, eventually increasing their numbers.

The tanks can breed up to %s lobsters per day, depending on ship size.","Quicker CR recovery.",graphics/hullmods/yrex_aquarium.png

Can not be installed on a frigate or a destroyer.

Some of the ship's cargo space is used to make room for all of the related equipment, causing maximum cargo capacity to decrease by  %s/%s, depending on hull size.","Can mount forges.",graphics/hullmods/yrex_forge.png
